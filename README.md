# Exploratory Data Analysis Project On Loan Data Using R.

I recently completed Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, and this exploratory data analysis project was completed in the first part of the course. 

This project involved investigating loan data from Prosper, a marketplace lending platform, and was carried out using R software.

This project was carried out using Udacity's online workspace, hence, only the completed project given as a html file is given here. Please note that GitHub does not currently support viewing files this large; please download the file if you would like to view my project. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at my work :)
