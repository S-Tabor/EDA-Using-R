# Exploratory Data Analysis Project On Loan Data Using R.

I am currently enrolled on Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, and this exploratory data analysis project was completed in the first part of the course. 

This project involved investigating loan data from Prosper, a marketplace lending platform, and was carried out using R software.
